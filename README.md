Thunder (also known as Thunder) is an open-source plugin-based device abstraction layer, where business functionality can be implemented as plugins and applications can query and control those plugins. Using Thunder provides a consistent interface-driven development model for both plugins and client applications, with an RPC engine that is suited to both web-based and native apps.

Designed from the ground up for embedded platforms and written in C++11, Thunder can be run on even the most low-power of devices (including ARM and MIPS-based platforms).
