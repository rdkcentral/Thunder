ThunderTools do contain a number of tools that can support you in developing Plugins.

To make usage of these tools easier there is also a main menu that can be used to see an overview of currently existing tools and also allows a tool to be started directly from this menu.

To start the Thunder Developer Tools main menu:

1. Goto the folder you want the tool to be started in (e.g. some tools will create files in the folder they are started in)
2. From that folder call the ThunderDevTools.py from the ThunderTools/ThunderDevTools folder (e.g. ../ThunderDevTools/ThunderDevTools.py)
