# This script is designed to power off framebuffer devices (fb0, fb1, etc.) 
# after a delay of 8 seconds. It performs the following steps:
# 1. Waits for 8 seconds using the `sleep` command.
# 2. Iterates over all framebuffer device "blank" files located in 
#    /sys/class/graphics/fb*/blank.
# 3. Writes the value `1` to each "blank" file, which signals the framebuffer 
#    to turn off or enter a low-power state.
# 4. Runs the entire operation in the background using the `&` operator.
